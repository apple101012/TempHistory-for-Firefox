# Temporary History for Incognito Tabs - Firefox Extension

## Overview

Welcome to the **Temporary History for Incognito Tabs** extension!  
This Firefox extension is designed for those who use incognito mode frequently but find it frustrating when tabs accidentally close or one-time links disappear without a trace.

### Developed with:

- **HTML/CSS** for a clean and simple interface
- **JavaScript** for seamless functionality and data management
- **Firefox Storage API** to securely save temporary history within the current incognito session

## Why Use This Extension?

If you've ever used incognito mode, you know that once a tab closes or you exit the browser, your browsing history is gone. However, there are situations when you may need to retrieve a link from the incognito session, especially if you:

- Accidentally close a tab
- Need to revisit a one-time link
- Lose a page in the middle of researching or exploring

With this extension, you have **peace of mind** knowing that you can access a **temporary history** of your incognito session anytime within the session. This extension is not only useful but also non-intrusive, as it clears the history automatically when the session ends.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easily view, open, or delete individual links directly from the extension popup.
- **Group Selection**: Select multiple links and delete them at once.
